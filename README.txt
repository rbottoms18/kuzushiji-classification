Abstract
A K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, a Fully Connected Neural Network, and a Convolutional Neural Network are applied
to the classification of a large, unbalanced dataset of images of kuzushiji. The analysis focuses on testing accuracy
and testing runtime as well as the effects of dimension reduction on both accuracy and runtime.

----------------------------------------------

The scripts in this project require the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset given here (Version 3):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anokas/kuzushiji

To run the scripts, please download the data and extract all of it to a folder named Data
in the same directory.
